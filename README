It serves as a beginner-friendly project to practice and demonstrate fundamental web development skills such as structuring content with HTML and styling with CSS. The page displays a static layout for weather information and is ideal for those just starting out with frontend development. No JavaScript or APIs are used in this project â€” it's purely focused on design and layout basics.
